# CZON - AI-Native Markdown Content Engine

[> Website Demo](https://czon.zccz14.com/)

In the AI era, as website content creators, we can have a smarter content creation engine.

**Return to Content: Minimize Distractions, Focus on Writing**

Let documents return to their essence, and let writing return to tranquility.

First, I don't want to be a librarian. Sometimes I want to jot down some content, but I might not have thought of its title yet or formed a specific organization. I hope LLMs will automatically help me generate titles, create summaries, categorize, navigate, and handle other organizational tasks.

Second, my study must be kept tidy. I don't want complex build tools, complicated documentation configurations, or intricate structures. Every time I see the configuration files and project structures of tools like Docusaurus, VuePress, or Astro, I get a headache. Now, CZON chooses to hide all configurations in the `.czon` directory, sweeping them into a corner. Users only need to focus on writing content; CZON handles the rest. All other directories are your writing space; you can organize your Markdown files however you like.

**Return to Native Language: Write in Your Native Language, Smoothly Build Multilingual Versions**

Life is short; I'm too lazy to translate. People can best leverage the depth of their thinking when using their native language. But staying connected with the world is also necessary; I don't want to give up multilingual communication. So, I wish for a tool that allows me to write in my native language while enabling more people to see my content. Current i18n solutions not only require manual translation but also demand maintaining content updates, which is too cumbersome. I choose to use LLMs to handle translation for me, saving a lot of time and enabling one-click multilingual translation.

## Core Features

1. 🌍 **Automatic Multilingual Translation**: Uses AI for incremental translation, allowing users to write Markdown in their native language while supporting multilingual audiences.
1. 💭 **Automatic Summary Extraction**: Uses AI to analyze and extract key points from the original text.
1. 🏷️ **Automatic Tagging and Categorization**: Uses AI to extract and manage tags and categories for content.
1. 🧭 **Intelligent Categorization and Navigation**: Uses AI to generate site maps and navigation, independent of source file locations.

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

CZON includes a built-in SSG solution that can transform any Git folder containing Markdown into a static HTML site.

⚠️ Please note: CZON is not a professional static site generator (SSG) but an AI-driven Markdown content engine focused on content creation and management.

✅ CZON aims to simplify the content creation and publishing process, allowing users to focus on writing itself rather than being bogged down by complex configurations and tools.

❌ CZON does not offer complex theme customization or a plugin ecosystem. Instead, it focuses on enhancing content quality and accessibility through AI.

🔔 However, CZON can still generate static sites. If necessary, CZON can serve as a preprocessor and be integrated with other SSG solutions to create personalized, aesthetically pleasing sites.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (version 18 or above recommended, with `npx` command available)
- An [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) obtained, or an OpenAI-compatible API key
- Git installed (used to list Markdown files from Git, ignoring files filtered by `.gitignore` rules)

First, work within a folder already managed by Git:

Set environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxxxxx"  # Required: Replace with your OpenAI API Key
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"  # Optional, defaults to the official OpenAI API
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-3.5-turbo"  # Optional, defaults to the gpt-3.5-turbo model
```

Build the site with support for multilingual translation. Use the current directory as the source and output to the `.czon/dist` directory.

- You can specify the language versions to generate by using the `--lang` parameter multiple times (e.g., `--lang zh-Hans --lang en-US`).
- No source language configuration is needed; CZON will automatically detect it.

```bash
npx czon@latest build --lang zh-Hans --lang en-US
```
