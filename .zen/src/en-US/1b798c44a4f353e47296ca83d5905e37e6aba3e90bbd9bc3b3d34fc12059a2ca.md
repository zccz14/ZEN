# ZEN - A Minimalist Markdown Documentation Site Builder

> 📖 **Reading Note**: This README is the Chinese version. The English version will be automatically translated by AI.

## Project Motivation

### Return to Content

I enjoy contemplation, but I don't want to deal with complex build tools, fiddle with intricate documentation configurations, or manage complicated structures.

### Return to Native Language

Life is short, I use AI for translation. Stay connected with the world.

## Core Features

1.  **Static Site Generation**
    - Builds a static HTML site from any folder containing Markdown files.

2.  **Intelligent Navigation**
    - Generates a site map and navigation without requiring the original Markdown source files to maintain their directory structure.

3.  **Incremental i18n Translation**
    - Uses LLM for incremental i18n translation, allowing users to write Markdown in their native language while supporting multilingual audiences.

## Design Philosophy

- **Minimalism**: Minimal configuration, maximum flexibility.
- **Content-First**: Focus on writing, not tool configuration.
- **AI-Powered**: Leverage AI for translation and content organization.
- **Cross-Language**: Support multilingual content creation and presentation.

## Quick Start

### Recommended Usage

**It is recommended that users switch to the directory containing their Markdown files and directly use the following command to start building:**

```bash
npx zengen build
```

### Other Usages

1.  **Live Preview (Watch for file changes)**:

```bash
npx zengen build --watch
```

2.  **View more parameters or help**:

```bash
npx zengen
```

**Note**: ZEN enforces using the current directory as the source directory and outputs to the `.zen/dist` directory. It no longer supports specifying source and output directory parameters.

**ZEN** - Let documentation return to its essence, let writing return to tranquility.
