# ZEN - A Concise Markdown Documentation Site Builder

> 📖 **Reading Note**: This README is the Chinese version. The English version will be automatically generated by AI translation.

## Project Motivation

### Return to Content

I enjoy contemplation but dislike complex build tools, fiddling with intricate documentation configurations, and complicated structures.

### Return to Native Language

Life is short, I use AI translation. Stay connected with the world.

## Core Features

1. **Static Site Generation**
   - Build any folder containing Markdown files into a static HTML site.

2. **Intelligent Navigation**
   - Generate site maps and navigation without needing to maintain the original directory structure of the Markdown source files.

3. **Incremental i18n Translation**
   - Use LLM for incremental i18n translation, allowing users to write Markdown in their native language while supporting multilingual audiences.

## Design Philosophy

- **Minimalism**: Minimal configuration, maximum flexibility.
- **Content-First**: Focus on writing, not tool configuration.
- **AI-Powered**: Leverage AI for translation and content organization.
- **Cross-Language**: Support multilingual content creation and display.

## Quick Start

### Recommended Usage

**It is recommended that users switch to the directory containing Markdown files and directly use the following command to start building:**

```bash
npx zengen build
```

### Other Usages

1. **Live Preview (Watch for file changes)**:

```bash
npx zengen build --watch
```

2. **View more parameters or help**:

```bash
npx zengen
```

**Note**: ZEN enforces using the current directory as the source directory and outputs to the `.zen/dist` directory. Specifying source and output directory parameters is no longer supported.

**ZEN** - Let documentation return to its essence, let writing return to tranquility.
