# ZEN - A Minimalist Markdown Documentation Site Builder

> 📖 **Reading Note**: This README is the Chinese version. The English version will be automatically generated by AI translation.

## Project Motivation

### Return to Content

I enjoy contemplation, but I don't want to deal with complex build tools, fiddle with intricate documentation configurations, or navigate complicated structures.

### Return to Native Language

Life is short, I use AI for translation. Stay connected with the world.

## Core Features

1.  **Static Site Generation**
    - Builds any folder containing Markdown files into a static HTML site.

2.  **Intelligent Navigation**
    - Generates a site map and navigation automatically, without requiring you to maintain the original directory structure of your Markdown source files.

3.  **Incremental i18n Translation**
    - Utilizes LLMs for incremental internationalization (i18n) translation. Write your Markdown in your native language, while your audience can be multilingual.

## Design Philosophy

- **Minimalism**: Minimal configuration, maximum flexibility.
- **Content-First**: Focus on writing, not tool configuration.
- **AI-Powered**: Leverage AI for translation and content organization.
- **Cross-Language**: Supports multilingual content creation and presentation.

## Quick Start

### Recommended Usage

**It is recommended to switch to the directory containing your Markdown files and start building directly with the following command:**

```bash
npx zengen build
```

### Other Usages

1.  **Live Preview (Watch for file changes)**:

```bash
npx zengen build --watch
```

2.  **View more parameters or help**:

```bash
npx zengen
```

**Note**: ZEN enforces using the current directory as the source directory and outputs to the `.zen/dist` directory. Specifying source and output directory parameters is no longer supported.

**ZEN** - Return documentation to its essence, return writing to tranquility.
