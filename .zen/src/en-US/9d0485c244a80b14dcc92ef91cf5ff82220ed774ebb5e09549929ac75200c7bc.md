# Usage Tips

## Declaring Dates in the Body Text

Within the body text, you can use date declarations like "Today is January 8, 2026" (the format style is flexible), and ZEN will automatically recognize and process it.

Traditional Markdown documents declare dates through YAML Frontmatter, which requires remembering the corresponding field; otherwise, the date may not be correctly identified.

ZEN supports declaring dates directly within the body text, avoiding the issue of forgetting to fill in the Frontmatter field.

The AI will automatically extract and infer date information from the body text and process it as the document's creation date.

This method is more flexible and intelligent, enhancing the user experience.

As a side note, documents with dates can generate a timeline view, making browsing and management easier. This is particularly suitable for content types like diaries and blogs that require a timeline.
