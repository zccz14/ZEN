# ZEN - A Minimalist Markdown + AI Static Site Builder

[> Website Demo](https://zccz14.github.io/ZEN/)

## Core Features

1. 📃 **Static Site Generation**: Build a static HTML site from any git-managed folder containing Markdown files.
2. 🧭 **Intelligent Categorized Navigation**: Use AI to analyze content, generating a site map and navigation that is independent of the original file structure.
3. 🌍 **Automatic Incremental Translation**: Use AI for incremental translation, allowing users to write Markdown in their native language while supporting multilingual audiences.

Why create another Markdown static site generator? I've reconsidered how documentation tools can better serve writers in the AI era:

- **Return to Content: Minimize Distractions, Focus on Writing**

  Bring documentation back to its essence and restore tranquility to the writing process.

  First, I don't want to be a librarian. Sometimes I want to jot down ideas before I've settled on a title or organized them fully. I want an LLM to automatically generate titles, create summaries, categorize content, and handle navigation.

  Second, my workspace must stay clean. I don't want complex build tools, intricate documentation configurations, or convoluted structures. Tools like Docusaurus, VuePress, and Astro often overwhelm me with their configuration files and project layouts. ZEN hides all configuration in a `.zen` directory, tucked out of sight. Users can focus solely on writing, leaving the rest to ZEN. All other directories are your writing space—organize your Markdown files however you like.

- **Return to Native Language: Write in Your Mother Tongue, Seamlessly Build Multilingual Versions**

  Life is short; I don't want to translate. People think most deeply in their native language. Yet, staying connected to the world is essential—I don't want to give up multilingual communication. I needed a tool that lets me write in my native language while making my content accessible to a broader audience. Traditional i18n requires manual translation and ongoing content maintenance, which is too cumbersome. I chose to use LLMs for translation, saving significant time and enabling one-click multilingual support.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (version 18 or higher recommended, with `npx` command available)
- An [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) or a compatible OpenAI API key
- Git installed (used to list Markdown files from a Git repository, ignoring files filtered by `.gitignore` rules)

First, work within a folder already managed by Git:

Set environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxxxxx"  # Required: Replace with your OpenAI API Key
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"  # Optional, defaults to the official OpenAI API
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-3.5-turbo"  # Optional, defaults to the gpt-3.5-turbo model
```

Build the site with support for multilingual translation. Use the current directory as the source and output to the `.zen/dist` directory.

- Specify language versions using the `--lang` parameter multiple times (e.g., `--lang zh-Hans --lang en-US`).
- Set the site's base URL prefix with the `--base-url` parameter (e.g., for a GitHub Pages repository name).
- No need to configure the source language—ZEN detects it automatically.

```bash
npx zengen@latest build --lang zh-Hans --lang en-US
```

```bash
