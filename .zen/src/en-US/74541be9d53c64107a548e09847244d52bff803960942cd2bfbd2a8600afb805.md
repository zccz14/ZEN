# ZEN - Minimalist Markdown + AI Static Site Builder

[> Website Demo](https://zccz14.github.io/ZEN/)

## Core Features

1. 📃 **Static Site Generation**: Builds a static HTML site from any git-managed folder containing Markdown files.
2. 🧭 **Intelligent Categorization & Navigation**: Uses AI for content analysis to generate a sitemap and navigation, independent of source file locations.
3. 🌍 **Automatic Incremental Translation**: Employs AI for incremental translation, allowing users to write Markdown in their native language while supporting multilingual audiences.

Why create another Markdown static site generator? I've reconsidered how documentation tools can better serve writers in the AI era:

- **Return to Content: Minimize Distractions, Focus on Writing**

  Let documentation return to its essence and writing to its tranquility.

  First, I don't want to be a librarian. Sometimes I want to jot down ideas before finalizing titles or organizing them perfectly. I wish LLMs could automatically generate titles, summaries, categories, and navigation for me.

  Second, my workspace must be clean. I dislike complex build tool configurations, intricate documentation setups, and convoluted structures. Tools like Docusaurus, VuePress, and Astro often give me headaches with their config files and project layouts. ZEN hides all configuration in a `.zen` directory, tucked away in a corner. Users only need to focus on writing content; ZEN handles the rest. All other directories are your writing space, where you can organize Markdown files freely.

- **Return to Native Language: Write in Your Mother Tongue, Build Multilingual Versions Smoothly**

  Life is short; I'm too lazy to translate. People think most deeply in their native language. Yet, connecting with the world is essential, and I don't want to give up multilingual communication. I desire a tool that lets me write in my native language while making my content accessible to a broader audience. Traditional i18n requires manual translation and content update maintenance, which is too cumbersome. I choose to use LLMs for translation, saving significant time and enabling one-click multilingual builds.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (version 18 or above recommended, `npx` command required)
- [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) obtained, or an OPENAI-compatible API Key
- Git installed (used to list Markdown files from Git, ignoring files filtered by `.gitignore` rules)

First, work within a folder already managed by Git:

Set environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxxxxx"  # Required: Replace with your OpenAI API Key
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"  # Optional, defaults to the official OpenAI API
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-3.5-turbo"  # Optional, defaults to the gpt-3.5-turbo model
```

Build the site with support for multilingual translation. Uses the current directory as the source and outputs to the `.zen/dist` directory.

- Specify language versions to generate using the `--lang` parameter multiple times (e.g., `--lang zh-Hans --lang en-US`).
- Specify the site's base URL prefix using the `--base-url` parameter (e.g., the repository name on GitHub Pages).
- No need to configure the source language; ZEN will auto-detect it.

```bash
npx zengen@latest build --lang zh-Hans --lang en-US
```
