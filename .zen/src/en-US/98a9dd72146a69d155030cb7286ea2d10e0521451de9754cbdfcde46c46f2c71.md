'title': 'ZEN - Minimalist Markdown + AI Static Site Builder'
'summary': 'ZEN is a static site generator with AI capabilities, designed specifically for Markdown documents. It allows users to convert a Git folder containing Markdown files into a static HTML site without complex configuration—all settings are hidden in the .zen directory. Core features include intelligent categorization and navigation (using AI to analyze content and generate a sitemap), automatic incremental translation (supporting multilingual versions, enabling users to write in their native language with AI handling translation), and a minimally disruptive writing experience. The quick start guide requires installing Node.js, obtaining an OpenAI API Key and Git, building the site via the command line, and supports specifying languages and base URLs.'

# ZEN - Minimalist Markdown + AI Static Site Builder

[> Website Demo](https://zen.zccz14.com/)

## Core Features

1. 📃 **Static Site Generation**: Build any Git folder containing Markdown files into a static HTML site.
2. 🧭 **Intelligent Categorization and Navigation**: Uses AI to analyze content, generating a sitemap and navigation that is insensitive to source file locations.
3. 🌍 **Automatic Incremental Translation**: Uses AI for incremental translation, allowing users to write Markdown in their native language while supporting multilingual output.

Why create another Markdown static site generator? I've reconsidered how documentation tools can better serve writers in the AI era:

- **Return to Content: Minimize Distractions, Focus on Writing**

  Bring documentation back to its essence and restore tranquility to writing.

  First, I don't want to be a librarian. Sometimes I want to jot down ideas without having finalized titles or organizational structures. I want LLMs to automatically generate titles, summaries, categories, navigation, and other organizational tasks.

  Second, my workspace must stay clean. I don't want complex build tools, cumbersome documentation configurations, or intricate structures. Every time I see the configuration files and project structures of tools like Docusaurus, VuePress, or Astro, I get a headache. Now, ZEN hides all configurations in the `.zen` directory, tucked away in a corner. Users only need to focus on writing content; ZEN handles the rest. All other directories are your writing space—organize your Markdown files freely.

- **Return to Native Language: Write in Your Mother Tongue, Seamlessly Build Multilingual Versions**

  Life is short; I can't be bothered with translation. People express their deepest thoughts best in their native language. Yet, staying connected to the world is essential, and I don't want to give up multilingual communication. I wanted a tool that lets me write in my native language while making my content accessible to a broader audience. Traditional i18n requires manual translation and content maintenance, which is too cumbersome. I chose to use LLMs for translation, saving significant time and enabling one-click multilingual translation.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (version 18 or higher recommended, with `npx` command available)
- [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) obtained, or an OpenAI-compatible API Key
- Git installed (used to list Markdown files from Git, ignoring files filtered by `.gitignore` rules)

First, work in a folder already managed by Git:

Set environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxxxxx"  # Required: Replace with your OpenAI API Key
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"  # Optional, defaults to OpenAI's official API
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-3.5-turbo"  # Optional, defaults to the gpt-3.5-turbo model
```

Build the site with support for multilingual translation. Uses the current directory as the source and outputs to the `.zen/dist` directory.

- Specify language versions to generate using the `--lang` parameter multiple times (e.g., `--lang zh-Hans --lang en-US`).
- Specify the site's base URL prefix with the `--base-url` parameter (e.g., a repository name on GitHub Pages).
- No need to configure the source language; ZEN automatically detects it.

```bash
npx zengen@latest build --lang zh-Hans --lang en-US
```
