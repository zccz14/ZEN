# ZEN - A Minimalist Markdown Documentation Site Builder

[简体中文](https://zccz14.github.io/ZEN/zh-Hans) | [English](https://zccz14.github.io/ZEN/en-US)

Why create another Markdown static site generator? I've been rethinking how documentation tools can better serve writers in the AI era:

- **Return to Content**: Minimize distractions, focus on writing.

  Let documentation return to its essence, and let writing return to tranquility.

  First, I don't want to be a librarian. Sometimes I want to jot down some content, but I might not have thought of a title yet, or haven't formed a specific structure. I hope LLMs will automatically help me generate titles, summaries, categorize, and organize navigation.

  Second, my study must be kept tidy. I don't want complex build tools, fiddling with intricate documentation configurations, or complicated structures. Every time I see the configuration files and project structures of tools like Docusaurus, VuePress, or Astro, my head hurts. Now, ZEN chooses to hide all configurations in the `.zen` directory, swept into a corner. Users only need to focus on writing content; everything else is handled by ZEN. All other directories are your writing space; you can organize your Markdown files however you like.

- **Return to Native Language**: Write in your native language, build multilingual versions seamlessly.

  Life is short; I'm too lazy to translate. People can best express the depth of their thinking when using their native language. Yet, staying connected to the world is necessary; I don't want to give up multilingual communication. So, I wanted a tool that allows me to write in my native language while enabling more people to see my content. Current i18n solutions not only require manual translation but also self-maintenance of content updates, which is too troublesome. I choose to use LLMs to handle translation for me, saving a lot of time and enabling one-click translation into multiple languages.

## Core Features

1. **Static Site Generation**
   - Build any folder containing Markdown files into a static HTML site.

2. **Intelligent Navigation**
   - Generate site maps and navigation. You don't need to maintain the original directory structure of the Markdown source files; you can move source files around freely.

3. **Incremental i18n Translation**
   - Use LLMs for incremental i18n translation, allowing users to write Markdown in their native language while the site can be multilingual.

## Design Philosophy

- **Minimalism**: Minimal configuration, maximum flexibility.
- **Content First**: Focus on writing, not tool configuration.
- **AI-Powered**: Leverage AI for translation and content organization.
- **Cross-Language**: Support multilingual content creation and display.

## Quick Start

### Recommended Usage

**It is recommended to switch to the directory containing your Markdown files and directly use the following command to start building:**

```bash
# Set environment variables (modify according to your actual situation)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxxxxx"  # Required: Replace with your OpenAI API Key
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"  # Optional, defaults to the official OpenAI API
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-3.5-turbo"  # Optional, defaults to the gpt-3.5-turbo model

# Build the site with support for multilingual translation
npx zengen@latest build --lang zh-Hans --lang en-US --verbose
```

**To view more parameters or help**:

```bash
npx zengen
```

**Note**: ZEN enforces using the current directory as the source directory and outputs to the `.zen/dist` directory. It does not support specifying source and output directory parameters.
