'title': 'ZEN - Minimalist Markdown + AI Static Site Builder'
'summary': 'ZEN is an AI-powered static site generator focused on simplifying documentation writing and building. It allows users to create static HTML sites from git-managed folders using Markdown, with no complex configuration—all settings are hidden in the .zen directory. Core features include intelligent categorization and navigation (generating site maps via AI content analysis), automatic incremental translation (supporting multilingual versions, enabling users to write in their native language while AI handles translation), and a minimally disruptive writing experience. The tool relies on Node.js, an OpenAI API Key, and Git, enabling quick builds via the command line and supporting language parameters such as zh-Hans and en-US.'

# ZEN - Minimalist Markdown + AI Static Site Builder

[> Website Demo](https://zen.zccz14.com/)

## Core Features

1. 📃 **Static Site Generation**: Build a static HTML site from any git-managed folder containing Markdown files.
2. 🧭 **Intelligent Categorization and Navigation**: Use AI to analyze content, generating site maps and navigation independent of source file locations.
3. 🌍 **Automatic Incremental Translation**: Use AI for incremental translation, allowing users to write Markdown in their native language while supporting multilingual output.

Why create another Markdown static site generator? I’ve reconsidered how documentation tools can better serve writers in the AI era:

- **Return to Content: Minimize Distractions, Focus on Writing**

  Bring documentation back to its essence and restore tranquility to writing.

  First, I don’t want to be a librarian. Sometimes I want to jot down ideas without having finalized titles or organized structures. I want LLMs to automatically generate titles, summaries, categories, navigation, and other organizational tasks.

  Second, my workspace must stay clean. I don’t want complex build tools, intricate documentation configurations, or convoluted structures. Tools like Docusaurus, VuePress, and Astro with their configuration files and project structures give me a headache. ZEN hides all configurations in the `.zen` directory, tucked away in a corner. Users can focus solely on writing content, leaving the rest to ZEN. All other directories are your writing space—organize your Markdown files however you like.

- **Return to Native Language: Write in Your Mother Tongue, Seamlessly Build Multilingual Versions**

  Life is short; I can’t be bothered with translation. People think most deeply when using their native language. Yet, staying connected to the world is essential—I don’t want to give up multilingual communication. I wanted a tool that lets me write in my native language while making my content accessible to more people. Traditional i18n requires manual translation and content maintenance, which is too cumbersome. I chose to use LLMs for translation, saving significant time and enabling one-click multilingual translation.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (version 18 or higher recommended, with `npx` command available)
- An [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) or compatible OpenAI API key
- Git installed (used to list Markdown files from Git, ignoring files filtered by `.gitignore` rules)

First, work within a folder already managed by Git:

Set environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxxxxx"  # Required: Replace with your OpenAI API Key
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"  # Optional, defaults to OpenAI's official API
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-3.5-turbo"  # Optional, defaults to the gpt-3.5-turbo model
```

Build the site with support for multilingual translation. Use the current directory as the source and output to the `.zen/dist` directory.

- Specify language versions using the `--lang` parameter multiple times (e.g., `--lang zh-Hans --lang en-US`).
- No need to configure the source language—ZEN automatically detects it.

```bash
npx zengen@latest build --lang zh-Hans --lang en-US
```

```bash
