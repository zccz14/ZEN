# ZEN - A Minimalist Markdown Documentation Site Builder

[简体中文](https://zccz14.github.io/ZEN/zh-Hans) | [English](https://zccz14.github.io/ZEN/en-US)

Why create another Markdown static site generator?

- **Return to Content**: Minimize distractions, let you focus on writing

  Let documentation return to its essence, let writing return to tranquility. I don't want complex build tools with complicated configurations, I dislike fiddling with intricate documentation setups and convoluted structures. Every time I see the configuration files and project structures of tools like Docusaurus, VuePress, or Astro, my head hurts. Now, ZEN chooses to hide all configuration in the `.zen` directory, sweeping it into a corner. Users only need to focus on writing content; ZEN handles the rest. All other directories are your writing space; you can organize your Markdown files however you like. LLMs will automatically help you generate titles, create summaries, categorize, and generate navigation. You really only need to focus on writing.

- **Return to Native Language**: Write only in your native language, smoothly build multilingual versions

  Life is short, I'm too lazy to translate. People can best express the depth of their thinking when using their native language. But staying connected to the world is also necessary; I don't want to give up multilingual communication. So I wanted a tool that allows me to write in my native language while also letting more people see my content. Current i18n solutions not only require you to translate yourself but also to maintain content updates, which is too troublesome. I choose to use LLMs to handle translation for me, saving me a lot of time and enabling one-click translation into multiple languages.

## Core Features

1. **Static Site Generation**
   - Build any folder containing Markdown files into a static HTML site.

2. **Intelligent Navigation**
   - Generate site maps and navigation without needing to maintain the original directory structure of the Markdown source files.

3. **Incremental i18n Translation**
   - Use LLMs for incremental i18n translation, allowing users to write Markdown in their native language while the audience can be multilingual.

## Design Philosophy

- **Minimalism**: Minimal configuration, maximum flexibility.
- **Content-First**: Focus on writing, not tool configuration.
- **AI-Powered**: Leverage AI for translation and content organization.
- **Cross-Language**: Support multilingual content creation and display.

## Quick Start

### Recommended Usage

**It is recommended that users switch to the directory containing their Markdown files and directly use the following command to start building:**

```bash
npx zengen build
```

**To view more parameters or help:**

```bash
npx zengen
```

**Note**: ZEN enforces using the current directory as the source directory and outputs to the `.zen/dist` directory. It does not support specifying source and output directory parameters.
